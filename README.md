# ID-MAGE_Completeness
Algorithm detection efficiency and visual inspection completeness files for the survey ID-MAGE

Three sets of folder are available related to this prject.  Inside each folder are 35 files with one file per host.  These text files include the recovery fraction for each combination of magntide and effective radius.  They are: 
  ## Algorithm
This folder containts the recovery fractions per magntidue and effective radius bin for the algorithm alone.

  ## Full_Sample
This foder ciontains the files with the recovery fraction from the aglorithm combine with the visual inspection recovery rate for the full sample

  ## High-Likelihood
This foder ciontains the files with the recovery fraction from the aglorithm combine with the visual inspection recovery rate for objects that were visually rated to be high-likelihood satellites
