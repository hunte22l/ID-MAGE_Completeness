# ID-MAGE_Completeness
Algorithm detection efficiency and visual inspection completeness files for the survey ID-MAGE (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250400253H/abstract)

Three sets of folder are available in the repository related to ID-MAGE.  Inside each folder are 35 files with one file per host.  These text files include the recovery fraction for each combination of magntide and effective radius.  They are: 
  ## Algorithm
This folder contains the recovery fractions per magntidue and effective radius bin for the low-surface brightness dwarf detection galaxy algorithm alone.
Additional information about the number of galaxies injected per size and magnitude bin is included here

  ## Full-Sample
This folder contains the files with the recovery fraction from the aglorithm combined with the visual inspection recovery rate for the full sample

  ## High-Likelihood
This fo;der contains the files with the recovery fraction from the aglorithm combined with the visual inspection recovery rate for objects that were visually rated to be high-likelihood satellites
